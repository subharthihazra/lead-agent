## Features

- üîÅ CLI and API support for AI-driven lead qualification
- üß† LLM-powered conversation using smart prompts
- üß© Industry-specific configuration support
- ‚úÖ Lead classification (Hot, Cold, Invalid)
- üìù Metadata extraction (location, budget, property type, etc.)
- üßæ Persistent session manager with summaries and transcripts
- üñ•Ô∏è Web dashboard using React + Vite
- üîê Gemini LLM support via `@langchain/google-genai`
